# First Challenge
## Welcome to your Lesson 3 Challenge 1
## Challenge: Meaningful structure

In these upcoming challenges, you will create your own recipe based on the approach taken in the course videos. Your first challenge is to create the core HTML in order to create your own recipe page.

In particular, you will:

- Add a header area with placeholder text for your recipe name and image
- Add a section with placeholder text for your ingredients list
- Add a section with placeholder text for preparation list
- Add a page footer with placeholder text for the content copyright

**Steps**

1. Add your recipe name to the  **\<title\>** element within the head.
2. Within the \< **body** \> element, add the following elements:

- Add a **\<header\>** element. Within the header add the placeholder text "  **recipe name, image, description"**
- Add two  **\<section\>** elements.
- Within the first  **\<section\>** add the placeholder text "  **ingredients list"**
- Within the second  **\<section\>** add the placeholder text "  **preparation list"**
- Add a  **\<footer\>** element. Within the footer add the placeholder text "  **copyright"**

Now that you have your boilerplate HTML in place, which includes the placeholder text. It is now time to start replacing the placeholder text with the required elements and  **your own recipe details**. We are going to do this over the following challenges.

For this challenge, you are going to add elements to the header and first section

In particular, you will add:

- The recipe name
- The recipe description
- The ingredients heading
- The list of ingredients


**Steps**

1. Remove the recipe name placeholder text and add an **\<h1\>** element to the  **\<header\>** giving it your recipe name
2. Remove the description placeholder text and add a  **\<p\>** element to the  **\<header\>** describing your recipe
3. Remove the ingredients placeholder text and add a **\<h2\>** element to the first  **\<section\>**. The heading text will be "  **ingredients"**
4. Remove the list placeholder text and add a  **\<ul\>** element to the first  **\<section\>**
5. The  **\<ul\>** should contain at least  **4 \<li\>** elements listing your recipe ingredients.
