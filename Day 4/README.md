# First Challenge
## Welcome to Lesson 4 - Challenge 1
## Challenge: A picture paints a thousand words

In the last two challenges, you added the following to your recipe page:

- The recipe name
- The recipe description
- The ingredients heading
- The list of ingredients
- The preparation heading
- The preparation steps
- The copyright text

All that's left in terms of content is the adding of a recipe image to the page.

Your challenge is to do just that.


**Steps**

1. Within the \< **header** \> element remove  **image** the placeholder text and add an  **\<img\>** element. Set its  **src** attribute value to "  **https://codeinstitute.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/5DCC/images/Content/oSVKMED.jpg**",
2. Or you can choose your own image. If you do, please make sure the image has a  **.png** or  **.jpg** file extension name
3. Give \< **img** \> element an  **alt** attribute. The alt attribute should be a short description of the image. Eg. _alt="A man drinking tea" _, The inclusion of the alt attribute helps screen readers determine content meaning for sight-impaired users

**Tips**

If you're stuck, the  **Recipe: Adding an image** video will give you everything you need to succeed.

Enjoy!

# Second Challenge
## Welcome to your Lesson 4 - Challenge 2
## Challenge: Responding to the look and feel


Having added all the HTML we require for the recipe page it is now time to start styling the page.

The most  **common** and most useful location for  **CSS** style rules in a **separate file** that is linked to one or more HTML documents that are targets of the styles. Why? Because a central change made to a style will update all the web pages that link to and use that style. Central location changes are easier to manage than multiple duplicated style content saved across many documents. So let's do that now.

In particular, you will:

- Style the default text font
- Size the main heading
- Color the headings
- Make the heading text uppercase

**Result**

Your result should look similar to the image below.

**Steps**

In the panel on the left, you will see there are two tabs, one of which is named  **index.css.** Note the  **.css**

Our HTML document named  **index.html** links to the CSS file on line 7.

Click on the  **index.css** file to view/edit/add style rules.

1. Create a style rule with a type selector that targets the  **\<body\>** element
2. Inside the  **body** rule set the  **font family** to  **Arial**
3. Inside the  **body** rule set the  **color** property to  **slategray**
4. Create a style rule with a type selector that targets the  **\<h1\>** element
5. Inside the  **h1** rule set the  **font-size** property to  **300%**
6. Create a style rule with a type selector that targets both  **\<h1\>** and  **\<h2\>** elements
7. Inside the  **h1, h2** rule set the  **color** property to  **orange**
8. Inside this rule set the  **text-transform** property to  **uppercase**
9. Inside this rule set the  **font-weight** property to  **100**
10. Create a style rule with a type selector that targets the  **\<img\>** element
11. Inside the  **img** rule set the  **width** property to  **100%**

**Tips**

If you're stuck, the  **Recipe: Core Styling** video will give you everything you need to succeed.

Enjoy!

3. Inside the  **footer** rule set the  **background-color** to  **orange**
4. Inside the  **footer** rule set the  **color** to  **white**
