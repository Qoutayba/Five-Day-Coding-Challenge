# First Challenge
## Welcome to Challenge 1
## Challenge: The world in color

In particular, you will:

- style a  **\<h1\>** element
- style a  **\<p\>** element
- style an  **\<em\>** element
- style a  **\<strong\>** element

You'll do this by using  **element selectors**  (style rules that have the same selector names as the HTML elements they are targeting).

In this challenge, each style rule will contain one style declaration that will target its associated HTML element.


**Steps**

As you can see in the edit panel to the left, we have already started this for you by

- creating a  **style rule** for the \<body\> element, using its  **HTML Element selector** name
- creating a  **declaration** giving it a font-size  **property**
- setting the  **property value* to 14px

1. Create an  **h1** style rule within the \<  **style** \> element and below the  **body**
2. Set the  **h1** rule  **color** property to  **gold**.  **-** _ **Note the US spelling of color -** _
3. Create a  **p** rule below the  **h1** rule
4. Set the  **p** rule **color** property to  **darkslategray**
5. Create an  **em rule** below the  **p** rule
6. Set the  **em** rule  **font-size** property to  **20px**
7. Create a  **strong** rule below the  **em** rule
8. Set the  **strong** rule  **font-size** property to  **24px**

**Tips**

As you might imagine, specifying a color by its name can be restricting given the millions of colours available to us on our screens.

- Do a web search to find out other ways of specifying color.
- In particular look at how  **hex** and  **RGB** color is used in CSS
- Why do we recommend searching? Well, at least once a day, even the most experienced developer will search the web looking for a solution to a problem they need to solve.
- Knowing how to fine-tune your internet search words and phrases is a skill every developer needs to have

If you're stuck, the  **CSS Overview** video will give you everything you need to succeed.

Enjoy!

# Second Challenge
## Welcome to Challenge 2
## Challenge: Putting on the style

In the previous challenge, you styled some HTML elements. You targeted the HTML by creating associated  **element**  style rules inside the inline  **\<style\>**  element.

You used one style declaration for each of the rules. However, a style rule can contain more than one style declaration.

Also in the last challenge, you were encouraged to search the web for other formats available to the  **color** property. By doing this you will have found you can also use  **RGB** and  **hex** formatting to specify millions of colors.

In this challenge, you will modify some of the rules created in your last challenge.

Also as part of this challenge, you will set some of the text colours using  **hex** and  **RGB**.

In particular, you will:

- Set the font type for the entire page
- Edit the heading text color
- Set all heading text to uppercase.
- Highlight emphasised text by assigning it a particular color.
- Highlight bold text by assigning it a particular color.

**Steps**

1. Add a  **font-family** property to the  **body** rule. Set it to  **Arial**
2. Change the style declaration for the  **h1** rule and use the  **hex** format for the  **color** property. Set the  **color** to  **#ffd700**
3. Add a  **text-transform** property to the  **h1** rule. Set the value to  **uppercase**.
4. Add a  **color** property to the  **em** rule using the  **RGB** format. Set the  **color** to **rgb(0, 128, 0)**
5. Add a  **color** property to the  **strong** rule using the  **RGB** format. Set the  **color** to **rgb(0, 0, 0)**

**Tips**

- Do a web search for the two CSS properties ( **text-transform** &  **font-family** ) needed to help you complete the challenge.
- Why do we recommend searching? Well, at least once a day, even the most experienced developer will search the web looking for a solution to a problem they need to solve.
- Knowing how to fine-tune your internet search words and phrases is a skill every developer needs to have.

# Third Challenge
## Welcome to Challenge 3
## Challenge: Uniqueness

Every HTML element can be assigned a unique identifier. This is done by including an  **id attribute and its associated value** in the element's opening tag. Element ids should be  **unique** to each element on a page. They should also be given a meaningful name that describes what the element is being used for. We can use CSS to target an  **id**

In particular, you will:

- Add an id and its value to a div element
- Add an id and its value to the div's child paragraph element
- You'll then target these ids with unique styles

**Steps**

A style rule that targets the div has already been created for you. You will need to create the second style rule to target the paragraph

1. Add an  **id** attribute to the \<  **div** \> element and give it the value "  **heading"**. Our  **#heading** style rule will now target that div
2. Add an **id** attribute to the  **\<p\>** element within the \<  **div** \> element, give it the value "  **uppercase"**
3. Create a style rule on line  **14** that has an id selector name of  **#uppercase.** This will target our paragraph
4. Within that rule add a declaration that sets the  **text-transform** property to  **uppercase**

**Tips**

If you're stuck, the  **Targeting An Individual** video will give you everything you need to succeed.

Enjoy!

# Fourth Challenge
## Welcome to Challenge 4
## Challenge: Grouping

Every HTML element can be assigned a  **class** identifier. This is done by including a  **class attribute** and its  **associated value** in the  **element's opening tag**. Elements that are  **conceptually grouped** in some way can be given the  **same class attribute value**. They should also be given a meaningful name that describes what the element grouping is being used for. We can use CSS to target  **class** attributes and apply a  **collective style** to those elements.

In the last challenge, you applied id styling to a Sporting History web page. In particular, you:

- Added an id and its value to a div element
- Added an id and its value to the div's child paragraph element
- You then targeted these ids with unique styles

This challenge will build upon the previous one.

In particular, you will:

- Group and style the sports-related content on your web page
- Group and style programming-related content on your web page


**Steps**

1. Add a  **class attribute** to the first two  **\<h3\>** elements and give each of them the attribute value of  **sports-history**
2. Add a  **class attribute** to the second two  **\<h3\>** elements and give each of them the attribute value of  **computing-history**
3. Create a style rule beneath the existing id rules that has a corresponding class selector name of  **sports-history.** This will target our sports content
4. Within that rule, add a declaration that sets the  **color** property to  **orange**
5. Create another style rule has a corresponding class selector name of  **computing-history.** This will target our programming content
6. Within that rule add a declaration that sets the  **color** property to  **green**

**Tips**

If you're stuck, the  **Targeting A Group ** video will give you everything you need to succeed.

Enjoy!
